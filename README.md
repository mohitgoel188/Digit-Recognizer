# Digit Recognizer

Digit recognizer can be used to recognize digits(0-9) from an image. This project uses an ANN model trained on MNIST dataset and have an accuracy of about 98%.

## Getting Started

The [MNIST.ipynb](https://github.com/mohitgoel188/Digit-Recognizer/blob/master/MNIST.ipynb) file is the main file which contains all relevant code.   
  
*.ipynb* is a python3 jupyter notebook and can be opened like any other jupyter notebook.

### Prerequisites

Python 3.6.x is required with following modules with their dependencies:-
* Tensorflow (with/without GPU support)  
    -- For constructing model,training,predicting
* Jupyter Notebook                            
    -- For interactive feedback
* Numpy                                       
    -- For numerical computation on arrays
* DateTime   (optional)                       
    -- For calculating a rough ETA
* Matplotlib (optional)                       
    -- For text image visualization

### Installing

Python 3 can be found at [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
All further modules can be installed by passing `pip install module_name` in the command shell(cmd, Windows Powershell,etc.) 

## Built With

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/) - The Machine learning framework
